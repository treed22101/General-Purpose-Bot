# General-Purpose-bot
A general purpose discord bot made with discord.py.
Moderation, setup, level system, and more.

## How To Use
1. Clone the repository

2. Set your token in the ```.env``` and install anything needed in ```requirements.txt```

3. If the token for any reason is not being imported properly, move the .env file to your DESKTOP and not your IDE dir.

4. Launch from ```bot.py```

5. !help to see all the commands of the bot so far.


## Setup Note
1. Some of the commands are not customized, so set them to your liking.

2. Certain cogs need channel ids and roles set. (```Autorole.py```, ```Greeting.py```, ```Logging.py```, ```Webscraper.py```)

3. Use !setmute {the name of the role} to set the mute role (create one).

4. I have a chatGPT feature set up so if you would like you can get a key and set it in the .env file. I have gpt-3.5-turbo set as the default model. You can change that as well.


## TODO
1. Fix the 4090 ti webscraper

2. Set up a starboard and music features
