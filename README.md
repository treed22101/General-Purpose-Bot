## General_Purpose_Bot
A general purpose discord bot made with discord.py.
Make sure to run the code from the file bot.py!


### To get running
Set your token for the bot in the .env file.

If the token for any reason is not being imported properly, move the .env file to your DESKTOP and not your text editor directory.

Banned words are not set, you can change in the main file bot.py, and add any other message detection.


### Requirements
See requirements.txt
