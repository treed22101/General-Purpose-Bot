# General_Purpose_Bot
A general purpose discord bot made with discord.py.
Moderation, setup, level system, and more.

## How To Use
1. Clone the repository

2. Set your token in the ```.env``` and install anything needed in ```requirements.txt```

3. If the token for any reason is not being imported properly, move the .env file to your DESKTOP and not your IDE dir.

4. Launch from ```bot.py```


# Setup Note
1. Some of the commands are not customized, so set them to your liking.

2. The role in ```Autorole.py```, banned words in ```main.py```, the logging channel name in ```Logging.py```, and the welcome channel id in ```Greeting.py``` all need to be set with roles and channels YOU create in your server, as well as words you don't want being said.

3. Use !setmute {the name of the role} to set the mute role (create one).
